                         KURIAN, J.

                         1.     Leave granted.



                         2.     The   appellants     are       before         this    Court,

                         aggrieved by the order dated 03.11.2016, passed

                         by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Writ

                         Appeal No. 623 of 2016.               The issue pertains to

                         the disputes between the respondent-workman and

                         the appellant-Management.



                         3.     Though this case has a chequered history, in

                         the nature of the order we propose to pass, it is

                         not    necessary    to   refer    to      all    those      aspects,

12:39:08 IST
Reason:



                         mediated      assistance     rendered           by    Mr.     Sanjay

                         Parikh, learned counsel, who graciously accepted
                                     2

the request made by the Court.



4.    The           relationship               between               the

respondent-workman           and    the    appellant-Management

has not been smooth and it has been strained to

the extent that the Management finally terminated

the respondent-workman from service.                      There are

several disputes with regard to his termination

and one case, being OS No. 242 of 2016 is now

pending before the City Civil Court at Chennai

and the proceedings under the Industrial Disputes

Act   are    also     said    to     be    pending      before       the

Conciliation Officer.



5.    Having       regard      to        the   fact      that        the

respondent-workman is only around 45 years and he

is able to work elsewhere and having regard to

the    background      of      the       strained      relationship

between the parties, we are of the view that it

is in the interests of both the parties to give a

quietus to the disputes.                  We are informed that

towards      the   gratuity        and    provident      fund,       the

respondent-workman is entitled to get an amount

of     Rs.     9.10         Lakhs.             Now,      when        the

employer-employee       relationship           is     coming    to    an
                                           3

end once and for all, we are of the view that the

respondent-workman             should also                 be appropriately

compensated.



6.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing on

both sides and having heard Mr.Thiruthanikumaran,

the respondent-workman, who is present before us,

we    are    of    the        view    that           in    full      and    final

settlement         of         the     entire              claims       of     the

respondent-workman,                 the    appellant            -    Management

should pay an amount of Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees

Twenty Five Lakhs).                 This payment is inclusive of

the   gratuity          and    provident             fund       or   any    other

claim of the respondent.                         In other words, the

respondent-workman shall not be entitled to raise

any     further         claim        on        any        counts     from     the

appellant-Management.



7.    In view of the order passed above, it is not

necessary         to    continue           the       civil       suit,      being

O.S.No.      242       of   2016,         pending          before     the    City

Civil       Court,      Chennai,           which          is,    accordingly,

struck off from its files.                           The Registry shall

communicate a copy of this Judgment to the City

Civil Court, Chennai forthwith.
                                        4



8.     The pending proceedings between the parties

under the Industrial Disputes Act or any other

forum shall also stand terminated.                           We direct

both    the    parties       not   to       indulge    in    any     other

litigation, either civil or criminal, in respect

of the employer-employee relationship without the

leave of this court.



9.     Towards     the        litigation           expenses,           the

respondent-workman shall also be entitled to a

further       amount    of    Rs.       50,000/-       (Rupees       Fifty

Thousand).             Hence,       the        total        amount      of

Rs.25,50,000/-         (Rupees      Twenty        Five       Lakhs     and

Fifty    Thousand)       will      be       credited    to    the     bank

account of the respondent-workman within 10 days

from today.



10. With the above observations and directions,

this appeal is disposed of.
