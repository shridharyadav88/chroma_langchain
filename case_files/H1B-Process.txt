The H1B Visa Process
Once you have been selected to apply for the H1B visa your employer can begin the process by filing a petition on your behalf

To do this your employer will need to submit a Labor Condition Application LCA to the Department of Labor DOL for Certification The purpose of the LCA is to confirm that your employer will pay you the same wage as other similarly qualified workers in the same geographic area and that your working conditions will not affect other employees

Once the LCA has been certified by the DOL your employer will have to complete Form I129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker and file both the LCA and the I129 to USCIS along with any fees and additional documentation These other documents may include evidence of your education any training certificates or professional membership documents if relevant your resume a confirmation letter of employment a letter of support and any necessary fees

If your Form I129 is approved then there are two options for you depending on whether you are in the United States already or not

If you are within the United States on a different visa category you must wait until your H1B visa status becomes active in order for you to start working

If you are outside the United States then you will need to apply for consular processing To do this you will need to complete Form DS160 which will take around 90 minutes to fill in You will also need to pay the application fee and schedule an interview at a US embassy or consulate near you

Once you have arranged an interview you will need to bring documents such as

Your passport This should be valid for at least six months beyond your intended date of entry to the United States
A printout of the confirmation page from your Form DS160
A copy of your approved I129 petition and your I797 approval
Receipts showing you have paid your application fees
A passportsized photo of you that follows US State Department requirements
During your interview you may be asked questions about yourself the job your experience the employer and your travel history
