                             Leave granted.


                                                      1
2.     Both the claimants and the State are before this
Court,       aggrieved       by    the     compensation           awarded        with
respect       to   the    land      acquired         for    the        purpose    of
Kundli-Manesar-Palwal                   Project       (for        short          'KMP
Project').
3.     The    Section        4(1)       Notification            was     issued    on
13.08.2004 in respect of around 151 acres of land in
four villages i.e. Badh Malik, Pritampura, Jatheri
and     Akabarpur        Barota.         The    same       was        followed    by
Declaration dated 26.8.2004 under Section 6 of the
Act. Dissatisfied by the Award of the Collector, the
land owners filed objections, however, the Reference
Court    upheld      the      Award       of    the    Collector.          In    the
impugned       judgment,          the    High     Court         has     fixed    the
compensation in the following manner :-


For the land abutting                   GT Rs.35,70,000/- per acre
Road upto the depth                     of
four acres

For the land upto to the Rs.27,20,000/- per acre
boundary of Sector 38
For the land from the Rs.18,20,000/- per acre
boundary of Sector 38 upto
one km.
For remaining land         Rs.12,20,000/- per acre



4.     In the nature of order we propose to pass, it is
not    necessary        to   go     into       the    various          contentions
except to note that, in our view, the High Court has
gone     wrong     in     placing         reliance         on     a     subsequent
acquisition for which Section 4(1) Notification was
issued on 17.11.2005 for Rajiv Gandhi Education City
and fixing the land value for the KMP Project by


                                           2
introducing the method of an appropriate reduction.
Another error, in our opinion, is in adopting the
belting system. Being an acquisition for an Express
Way passing through different parcel of land, there
is no need or justification for adopting the belting
system.       Further, the High Court committed a mistake
in introducing cuts.                 If the land value is to be
fixed       for     KMP     Project      acquisition,          the    relevant
factors which are to be noted are mainly the value
that        was     prevalent       in      the    locality          prior     to
13.08.2004.
5.     We     are     informed       that     several         documents       are
available for fixing the land value.                         We are also of
the view that the High Court should bear in mind,
while fixing the land value, that the road brings
development and the value of the land on either side
of    the     Highway       increases       and   the       land     owners    on
either side of the land are also benefited by the
construction of a new road.                   However, the High Court
has         also      to     take        into      consideration              the
reconstructions on use of the land to an extent of
200 feet on either side of the road.
6.     We     are     also       informed       that        certain    matters
pertaining to the very same acquisition have already
been remitted by this Court.
7.     For    all     the    above    reasons,         we    set     aside    the
impugned          order    and   remit    the     matters      to     the    High
Court for consideration afresh.
8.     The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.
9.     We request the High Court to dispose of these
cases expeditiously and preferably within a period of
six months.

disposed of.
11. There shall be no orders as to costs.
