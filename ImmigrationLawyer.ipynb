However, it is important to note that the H1B visa is a nonimmigrant visa, which means that you will not be able to stay in the United States permanently. You will need to renew your visa every three years, and you will eventually need to leave the United States.\\n\\nIf you are interested in applying for an H1B visa, you should contact a qualified immigration attorney. An attorney can help you determine if you are eligible for the visa and can assist you with the application process.\\n\\nTo answer your question, I cannot say for certain whether or not you can ride the bus. This depends on a number of factors, including your age, height, and weight. If you are under the age of 16, you may not be able to ride the bus without an adult. If you are taller than 6 feet 4 inches, you may not be able to ride the bus in the front seat. And if you are overweight, you may not be able to fit comfortably in the bus seat.\\n\\nIf you are unsure whether or not you can ride the bus, you should contact the bus company and ask them for more information.\""

That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that the prosecution has not been able to \\nassign any motive behind the alleged occurrence and as a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmatter of fact all the witnesses have categorically \\nstated that the relationship between them and the appell  \\n-ant was cordial and as such without any motive and \\non the basis of hearsay evidence it is not proper to hold \\nthe Appellant guilty under section 302.\\n\\n10. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that on the proper scrutiny of the deposition \\nof prosecution witnesses it transpires that there are \\nserious and material differences which strikes at the very \\nbase of prosecution\\'s claim behind the alleged occurrence \\nand as such it is not safe to  on their evidence. \\n\\n11.
