That the instant appeal has been preferred by \\nthe appellant against the Judgement and Order of convic- \\n-tion dated 17-20/11/2006, passed by Sri Ramesh Kumar \\nSrivastava, Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast \\nTrack Court No.1, Gumla in Sessions Trial Case No.15/2006 \\nwhereby and whereunder the Learned trial court has been \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npleased to find the appellant guilty for the offence \\nunder section 302/34 and sentenced him to undergo impri- \\n-sonment for life. \\n\\n2. That the appellant has not preferred any appeal \\nto this Hon\\'ble Court against the Judgement and \\nOrder of conviction prior to this. \\n\\n3. That the First Information Report in this instant \\ncase has been registered on the basis of written statement \\nof one Sant Kumar Oraon on 16.9.2005. \\n\\nThat the prosecution story in nutshell is that \\non 15.9.2005 his younger brother Vishwanath Oraon \\n(deceased) was dancing alongwith co-villagers Chawa Oraon \\n(deceased), Ramesh Oraon and Chotan Jhora, after consuming \\ncountry made liqour. Thereafter at about 9:30 p.m. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nco-villager Sushil Oraon came to the house of the \\n(informent) Sant Kumar Oraon and told that Vishwanath \\nOraon and Chawa Oraon have been murdered by Ramesh \\nOraon(Appellant), Chotan Jhora, Duti Devi and Sarsati \\nOraon by assaulting them with Lathi, Tangi, and a dagger. \\nThe dead body of Vishwanath Oraon is lying at the house \\nof Chotan Jhora and the dead body of Chawa Oraon is also \\nlying nearby. \\n\\nThe informent has further alleged that it was \\nalso told to him that both the deceased were taken from \\nthe place of playing Jhumar to the house of Chotan \\nJhora by Ramesh Oraon(Appellant) He has also alleged \\nthat on an enquiry he was told that by some villagers \\nthat they heard the wife of Chotan Jhora saying \"Keep \\nthem assaulting till they die\". The informant has also \\nexpressed his inability to spell out the motive behind \\nthe alleged occurrence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. That the prosecution in order to establish its \\ncase has examined altogether eitht witnesses out of \\nwhich  :-  \\n\\nP.W.-1 Prakash Oraon:- This witness is the seizure \\nlist witness and has proved his signature upon \\nseizer memo made for the articles recovered \\nfrom the house of co-accused Chotan Oraon. \\nAt para-1 this witness has stated that \\nthe police arrived at the place of occurrence \\non the next day of the alleged occurrence and \\nseized blood stained Bhujali, Lathi and Tangi \\nfrom the house of accused Chotan Jhora. \\n\\nP.W.-2 Rajendra Lohra:- This witness is also a seizure \\nlist witness and has at Para-1 of his evidence \\nstated that the police recovered a Bhujali and \\nTangi from the house of Chotan Jhora whereas the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLathi was recovered from the Bamboo bush of one \\nKapil Oraon. \\n\\nP.W.-3 Sandeep Oraon:- This witness is the brother of \\none of the deceased (Vishwanath Oraon) and is a \\nhearsay witness to the alleged occurrence. \\nAt Para-5 of his cross-examination he has \\nstated that there is no enimity between the accu- \\n-sed person and his family. \\n\\nP.W.-4 Jugesh Oraon :- This witness is also the brother \\nof one of the deceased (Vishwanath Oraon) and is \\na hearsay witness to the alleged occurrence. \\nAt Para-5 of his evidence he has stated that \\nhe was told by Sushil(P.W.-8) that Chotan Jhora, \\nRamesh Oraon, Duti Orain and Saraswati have given \\neffect to the alleged murder by assaulting the \\ndeceased persons. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe has also stated that in his cross exami- \\n-nation that the accused shared normal relation \\nwith his family.\\n\\nP.W.-5 Sant Kumar Oraon:- This witness is also the \\nbrother of one of the decaased Vishwanath Oraon \\nand is also a hearsay witness to the alleged \\noccurrence. \\n\\nAt Para 1 of his evidence he has stated that he \\ngot the information that the alleged occurrence \\nwas given effect by the accused persons through \\nSushil Oraon (P.W. 8). \\n\\nAt Para-7 of his cross examination he has stated \\nthat there was cordial relationship between the\\nfamily of Ramesh(Appellant) and his family. \\nHe has further stated that on the alleged \\ndate of occurrence all people were drunk. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP.W.-6 Dr. Mahendra Kumar Singh:- This witness is the \\ndoctor who conducted Post Mortem examination on \\nthe dead body of the deceased Chawa Oraon and \\nVishwanath Oraon on 16.29.2005. \\n\\nP.W.-7 Ramjee Mahto:- This witness is the investigating \\nofficer of the case and at Para-3 of his evidence \\nstated that the formal inquest report is not \\npresent in the diary.\\n\\nAt Para-10 of his evidence he has stated that no \\nincriminating material has been recovered from \\nthe house of Ramesh Oraon (Appellant). \\n\\nP.W.-8 Sushil Oraon:- This witness is also the brother \\nof the deceased Vishwanath Oraon and is a hearsay \\nwitness to the alleged occurrence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Para-1 of his evidence he has stated that on \\ngetting the information about the alleged occurr- \\nence from one Ganga Oraon he went to the place \\nof occurrence. \\n\\nIn the same Para he has further stated that he \\ncame to know that one Chotan Jhora has given effect \\nto the alleged occurrence. \\n\\nHe has further stated that he is not aware as to \\nwho apart from Chotan Jhora had given effect to \\nthe alleged occurrence. \\n\\nIn his cross examination he has further stated \\nthat he is making hearsay statement. \\n\\n5. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that there is no eye witness to the alleged \\noccurrence and the entire prosecution story relies hearing \\non circumstantial evidence. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that apart from the formal witnesses all \\nthe other witnesses are highly interested and related \\nwitnesses and as such to rely on their testimony when they \\nhave not witnessed the actual occurrence is not a  \\nsafe preposition. \\n\\n7. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that all the prosecution witnesses have \\nunanimously asserted that they came to know about the \\nappellants involvement in the alleged occurrence from \\nP.W.-8, but P.W. 8 who happens to be the only star witness \\nof the prosecution has not stated a word about the \\ninvolvement of this appellant(Ramesh Oraon) behind the \\nalleged occurrence. \\nHe has at Para-1 of his evidence stated that he \\ncame to know that the alleged occurrence was given effect \\nby one Chotan Jhora. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is also pertinent to mention herein that no \\nrecovery of dead body as well as weapon of assault was \\nmade from the house of the Appellant rather the same was made \\nfrom the house of Chotan Jhora. \\n\\n8. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that P.W.3/4 8, the star witness of the prose  \\ncution has stated that he got information about the \\nalleged occurrence from one Ganga Oraon. However, Ganga \\nOraon has not been examined by the prosecution and as \\nsuch the Appellant is entitled to the principle of optional \\npresumption under section 114 illustration \\n(G) of the Indian Evidence Act. \\n\\n9. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that the prosecution has not been able to \\nassign any motive behind the alleged occurrence and as a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmatter of fact all the witnesses have categorically \\nstated that the relationship between them and the appell  \\n-ant was cordial and as such without any motive and \\non the basis of hearsay evidence it is not proper to hold \\nthe Appellant guilty under section 302.\\n\\n10. That the Learned Trial Court failed to take into \\nconsideration that on the proper scrutiny of the deposition \\nof prosecution witnesses it transpires that there are \\nserious and material differences which strikes at the very \\nbase of prosecution\\'s claim behind the alleged occurrence \\nand as such it is not safe to  on their evidence. \\n\\n11.
